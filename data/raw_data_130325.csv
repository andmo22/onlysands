There is always a buzz here and I only recently found out that there is always a drum circle on the north side every Sunday. Sure is it kinds of insufferable on a hot Saturday at lunchtime? YES, but the other times make up for it.

There seemed to be a big culture of sand boarding down the mini dunes here which was cute, I liked that there's no houses facing onto it really, also that have an obscurely beautiful and modern slsc building.

Penrith Beach,West,Penrith,Lake,4,Yes,Cafe,"Kids & Families Only, Visit with Mates","I mean it's nicknamed Pondi. Okay but seriously, I actually had pretty low expectations for this spot. I mean it is definitely a lake not a beach but the list is sorely lacking in western Sydney representation. It's actually a really nice setting with the mountains in the background. I mean it's shipped in sand so the sand is quite shit, but this would be a really fun place to visit with friends if you all brought SUPs or blow ups (which a group of people did do and I was v jealous). Although there are alot of kids and families there is enough space to get that distance. ",,Visited,,-33.69431063,150.67686994371357

Lady Martin's Beach,East,Point Piper,"Harbour Beach, Sydney Harbour",6,Yes,,"Book Readers Delight, Chill, It's Giving Secret Beach, Romantic","This is the definition of a beach that I’m sure the point piper residents refer to a private beach, BUT IT’S NOT! It’s a weird one to get to, you need to go down a bunch of hidden paths if you’re walking there really small and you need to duck under a yacht club jetty, but when you arrive there it’s a freaking vibe. It’s set against beautiful sandstone walls and all of the boats are about a stones throw away which gives it a lot of character. It’s cute watching all the ferries go past and I even was taken back by the heavy bass from a cruise ship entering the harbour. It’s right next to a sea plane landing spot too so you feel like you’re living in a tiny little toy city. CUTE!

There was not a great vibe but I also didn't really give it a chance. It's definitely too big, but I do appreciate what they have done to make more of a promenade in the centre of it to give people a better chance at wayfinding there. In terms of the sand it's pure white, and it's also fun getting to see the planes landing and the kite surfers as well, but look I still didn't love it. I enjoyed rollerblading the promenade where you could more than being at the beach. I will say this though, in terms of interesting architecture from different periods, you will find it here closer to the north end, and that's a slay in my book.",,Visited,"Lady Robinson,  Monterey,  Kyeemagh",-33.96137594,151.15470954181433
